# RecyclingGameSubmission
Recyclora is the protoype for a game designed to encourage environmentally sustainable habits. By taking advantage of changes to behavioral patterns created by mobile games, users of this app will learn to recognize which waste belongs in recycling or compost rather than the trash.

With points for guessing correctly, and challenge modes in future versions, Recyclora is pretty fun too!
